Doing exercises to briefly review:
-**Today's Progress**: brief review to go to the challenges of this FreeCodeCamp course and get to "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours)"
**Thoughts:** Being using javascript during my work, although applied to a different area of front and back end, made me realize that I already knew concepts of language

### Day 6: 27/04/2019
##### Update aid tool for new social security rules in Brazil
 **Thoughts:** Today I made several attempts to improve the form of the tool and although I could not reach a conclusion of which was the best, I learned from the tests, seeing the possibilities of application, although I do not know how to use them completely. I spent several hours of the day trying to fix a Debian version update bug on my notebook, and although it was not coding, it made me see new technology stuff.
