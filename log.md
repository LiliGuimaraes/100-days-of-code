# 100 Days Of Code - Log

#### Day 1: 22/04/2019
## Recalling the basics of JavaScript using FreeCodeCamp exercises Doing exercises to briefly review:
**Today's Progress**: brief review to go to the challenges of this FreeCodeCamp course and get to "Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours)"
**Thoughts:** Being using javascript during my work, although applied to a different area of front and back end, made me realize that I already knew concepts of language.

**Today's Progress**: Based on the logical exercises from back-end course of the [REPROGRAMA project in Brazil](https://github.com/reprograma/On1-Logica/tree/master/exercicios-aula), I created the a simple form using HTML structure  and I created function in JS to calculate the user's age from the date of birth.

### Day 6: 27/04/2019
## Update aid tool for new social security rules in Brazil
 **Thoughts:** Today I made several attempts to improve the form of the tool and although I could not reach a conclusion of which was the best, I learned from the tests, seeing the possibilities of application, although I do not know how to use them completely. I spent several hours of the day trying to fix a Debian version update bug on my notebook, and although it was not coding, it made me see new technology stuff.
